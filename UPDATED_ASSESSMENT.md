## ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS SINCE LAST ASSESSMENT

### 1. ‚úÖ AEP Campaign Migration [PREVIOUSLY MAJOR - NOW COMPLETE]

**Status**: **FULLY RESOLVED** ‚úÖ  
**Previous Issue**: AEP was still handled as anniversary email type instead of campaign system  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed AEP from anniversary_email type** in `lib/domain/types.ml`
- **Complete database migration** with AEP campaign type and default instance
- **Updated all string conversion functions** to exclude AEP from anniversary handling
- **Modified follow-up queries** to properly handle AEP as campaign-based
- **Added automatic AEP campaign initialization** in database setup

**Evidence of Completion**:
```ocaml
(* lib/domain/types.ml - AEP no longer in anniversary emails *)
type anniversary_email = 
  | Birthday
  | EffectiveDate  
  | PostWindow
  (* AEP removed - now fully campaign-based *)

(* Database automatically creates AEP campaign *)
INSERT INTO campaign_types (name, ...) VALUES ('aep', ...);
INSERT INTO campaign_instances (campaign_type, instance_name, ...) 
VALUES ('aep', 'aep_default', ...);
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Follow-up Email System [PREVIOUSLY MAJOR - NOW COMPLETE]

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ  
**Previous Issue**: Database infrastructure existed but no active scheduling logic  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added `determine_followup_type` function** with sophisticated behavior analysis
- **Added `calculate_followup_emails` function** integrated into main scheduler
- **Implemented 4-tier follow-up classification**:
  - `HQWithYes`: Answered health questions with medical conditions (highest priority)
  - `HQNoYes`: Answered health questions, no medical conditions
  - `ClickedNoHQ`: Clicked links but didn't answer health questions
  - `Cold`: No engagement (lowest priority)
- **Added frequency limits respect** and exclusion window compliance
- **Integrated into main `schedule_emails_streaming` workflow**

**Evidence of Completion**:
```ocaml
(* Active follow-up scheduling in main workflow *)
let followup_schedules = calculate_followup_emails context in
let all_schedules = raw_result.schedules @ campaign_schedules @ followup_schedules in
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Campaign Instance Lifecycle Management [PREVIOUSLY MODERATE - NOW COMPLETE]

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ  
**Previous Issue**: Missing automated campaign activation/deactivation  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added `manage_campaign_lifecycle` function** with automatic date-based management
- **Integrated before campaign scheduling** in main workflow
- **Added metadata tracking** for lifecycle changes and audit trail
- **Automatic activation/deactivation** based on `active_start_date` and `active_end_date`

### 4. ‚úÖ Frequency Limit Enforcement [PREVIOUSLY MODERATE - NOW COMPLETE]

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ  
**Previous Issue**: Configuration existed but no active enforcement  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added `apply_frequency_limits` function** with sophisticated priority-based selection
- **Integrated into main scheduling workflow** before load balancing
- **Tracks both database and current batch emails** within period
- **Priority-based email selection** when limits exceeded (lower number = higher priority)
- **Comprehensive metrics tracking** for frequency-limited emails

### 5. ‚úÖ Post-Window Email Generation [PREVIOUSLY MODERATE - NOW COMPLETE]

**Status**: **ENHANCED AND INTEGRATED** ‚úÖ  
**Previous Issue**: Basic implementation but incomplete integration  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced `generate_post_window_for_skipped` function** with organization integration
- **Automatic generation** for emails skipped due to exclusion windows
- **Respects `organization.enable_post_window_emails` setting**
- **Integrated into main workflow** after conflict resolution
- **Comprehensive metrics tracking** for auto-generated post-window emails

### 6. ‚úÖ Campaign Priority Conflict Resolution [NEW BONUS FEATURE]

**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ  
**New Enhancement**: Added sophisticated campaign conflict resolution  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added `resolve_campaign_conflicts` function** for same-contact, same-date conflicts
- **Priority-based resolution** (lowest number wins)
- **Preserves non-campaign emails** (anniversary, follow-up) alongside campaigns
- **Detailed audit trail** with specific conflict reasons
- **Integrated before post-window generation** in main workflow
