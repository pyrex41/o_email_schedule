(** 
 * [generate_run_id]: Generates a unique run identifier for the current scheduling execution
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Creates a timestamp-based unique identifier for tracking a specific scheduler run.
 *   This ID is used to group all email schedules created during a single execution.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - None
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   String in format "run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS" representing the current timestamp
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Uses current datetime to ensure uniqueness across runs
 *   - Provides audit trail for scheduled emails
 *   - Enables tracking and debugging of specific scheduler executions
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called by create_context when initializing scheduling context
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - None expected (system time should always be available)
 * 
 * @integration_point
 *)

(** 
 * [create_context]: Creates a complete scheduling context for the current run
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Initializes all necessary components for email scheduling including configuration,
 *   unique run ID, timing, and load balancing settings based on total contact count.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - config: Configuration object containing organization settings and email timing
 *   - total_contacts: Total number of contacts to be processed for load balancing calculations
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   scheduling_context record with all initialized components
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Generates unique run ID for audit trail
 *   - Captures start time for performance tracking
 *   - Configures load balancing based on expected volume
 *   - Ensures consistent context across all scheduling operations
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called at the beginning of schedule_emails_streaming to initialize the session
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - None expected (all dependencies should be available)
 * 
 * @integration_point @state_machine

(** 
 * [calculate_spread_date]: Calculates deterministic spread date for campaign emails
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Distributes campaign emails evenly across a date range using contact ID as seed
 *   to ensure consistent but scattered scheduling for campaigns with spread_evenly=true.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - contact_id: Unique contact identifier used as distribution seed
 *   - spread_start_date: Start date of the spread period
 *   - spread_end_date: End date of the spread period
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   Date within the spread range, deterministically calculated for the contact
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Uses modulo operation on contact_id for deterministic distribution
 *   - Ensures each contact gets the same date on subsequent runs
 *   - Spreads load evenly across the available date range
 *   - Prevents clustering of campaign emails on specific dates
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called by calculate_campaign_emails when campaign_config.spread_evenly is true
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - None expected (valid date range assumed to be provided)
 * 
 * @business_rule @performance

(** 
 * [should_exclude_contact]: Determines if contact should be excluded from campaign
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Evaluates organization-level and campaign-specific exclusion rules for failed
 *   underwriting contacts to ensure compliance with business policies.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - config: Configuration containing organization exclusion settings
 *   - campaign_config: Campaign-specific configuration including exclusion rules
 *   - contact: Contact record with failed_underwriting flag
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   Option string - Some exclusion_reason if excluded, None if allowed
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Checks global organization policy for failed underwriting exclusion
 *   - Allows AEP campaigns even for failed underwriting when globally excluded
 *   - Respects campaign-specific failed underwriting skip settings
 *   - Provides specific exclusion reasons for audit purposes
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called by calculate_campaign_emails to filter contacts before scheduling
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - None expected (all inputs should be valid)
 * 
 * @business_rule
 *)

(** 
 * [is_contact_valid_for_scheduling]: Validates contact eligibility for campaign scheduling
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Determines if a contact has sufficient data for campaign scheduling based on
 *   email validity and location targeting requirements.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - config: Configuration containing organization policies
 *   - campaign_instance: Campaign instance with targeting constraints
 *   - contact: Contact record with email, zip_code, and state information
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   Boolean indicating if contact is valid for this campaign
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Requires valid email address for all campaigns
 *   - Checks if campaign has targeting constraints (states/carriers)
 *   - For targeted campaigns, requires location data (zip or state)
 *   - For universal campaigns, respects organization policy on missing location data
 *   - Handles "ALL" targeting as universal campaigns
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called by calculate_campaign_emails to validate each contact
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - Returns false for contacts with missing required data
 * 
 * @business_rule @data_flow
 *)

(** 
 * [should_send_effective_date_email]: Determines if effective date email should be sent
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Evaluates whether sufficient time has passed since a contact's effective date
 *   to warrant sending anniversary emails based on organization configuration.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - config: Configuration containing effective_date_first_email_months setting
 *   - _contact: Contact record (currently unused but preserved for future use)
 *   - effective_date: The contact's insurance effective date
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   Boolean indicating if effective date email should be sent
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Calculates months elapsed since effective date
 *   - Compares against organization minimum threshold
 *   - Prevents emails too soon after policy inception
 *   - Ensures regulatory compliance with timing requirements
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called by calculate_anniversary_emails before scheduling effective date anniversaries
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - None expected (date calculations should be valid)
 * 
 * @business_rule
 *)

(** 
 * [calculate_campaign_emails]: Generates email schedules for a specific campaign instance
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *   Core campaign scheduling logic that processes all eligible contacts for a campaign,
 *   applies business rules, handles exclusions, and creates email schedule records.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - context: Scheduling context with configuration and load balancing settings
 *   - campaign_instance: Specific campaign instance with targeting and timing data
 *   - campaign_config: Campaign type configuration with rules and settings
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   List of email_schedule records for all processed contacts in this campaign
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 *   - Retrieves contacts based on campaign targeting (all contacts vs specific list)
 *   - Validates each contact for campaign eligibility
 *   - Applies organization and campaign exclusion rules
 *   - Calculates schedule dates (spread evenly vs regular timing)
 *   - Handles exclusion windows if campaign respects them
 *   - Creates appropriate schedule status (PreScheduled vs Skipped)
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 *   Called by calculate_all_campaign_schedules for each active campaign instance
 * 
 * Error Cases:
 *   - Database errors when retrieving contacts return empty lists
 *   - Invalid contacts are skipped with Skipped status
 * 
 * @business_rule @data_flow @performance
