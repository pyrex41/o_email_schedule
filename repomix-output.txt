This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing files not matching ignore patterns, combined into a single document by Repomix.

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching these patterns are excluded: **/*.json
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded

# Email Scheduling Business Logic Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the email scheduling business logic implemented in the FastAPI application. It is designed to facilitate refactoring in a new language while preserving all business rules and functionality.

## Overview

The email scheduling system manages automated email and SMS campaigns for multiple organizations. It uses a sophisticated rule engine to determine when to send different types of communications based on contact information, state-specific regulations, and timing constraints. The system operates in Central Time (CT) and processes databases with up to 3 million contacts.

## Core Components

### 0. System Configuration

#### Time Zone and Processing
- **System Time Zone**: All operations run in Central Time (CT)
- **Processing Model**: Single instance processing (no concurrent schedulers)
- **Database Strategy**: Work with SQLite replica, sync results back to main database
- **Reprocessing**: Clear all pre-scheduled and skipped emails before each run

#### Key Constants (Configurable)
- **send_time**: Time of day to send emails (default: 08:30 CT)
- **batch_size**: Number of contacts to process in a batch (default: 10,000)
- **max_emails_per_period**: Maximum emails per contact per period (configurable)
- **period_days**: Number of days to consider for email frequency limits (configurable)
- **birthday_email_days_before**: Days before birthday to send email (default: 14)
- **effective_date_days_before**: Days before effective date to send email (default: 30)
- **pre_window_exclusion_days**: Extension for exclusion windows (default: 60)

### 1. Email Types

The system handles two categories of emails:

#### 1.1 Anniversary-Based Email Types
These are recurring emails tied to annual dates:
NOTE: these constants should be configurable, likely in a separate config file
- **Birthday**: Sent 14 days before a contact's birthday
- **Effective Date**: Sent 30 days before a contact's policy effective date anniversary
- **AEP (Annual Enrollment Period)**: Sent in September annually
- **Post Window**: Sent after an exclusion window ends (when other emails were skipped)

#### 1.2 Campaign-Based Email Types
These are flexible, configurable campaigns that can be triggered through various mechanisms:
- **Rate Increase**: Advance notification of premium changes
- **Initial Blast**: System introduction emails sent to all contacts
- **Custom Campaigns**: Configurable campaigns for promotions, policy updates, regulatory notices, etc.

Campaign-based emails offer per-campaign configuration of:
- Exclusion window compliance (can be enabled/disabled per campaign)
- Follow-up eligibility (can be enabled/disabled per campaign)
- Timing relative to trigger date (configurable days before/after)
- Target audience (all contacts or specific subset)

### 2. Contact Information Model

Each contact requires:
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **email**: Valid email address (required)
- **zip_code**: US ZIP code (required to get the state)
- **state**: US state (required)
- **birthday**: Date of birth (optional but needed for birthday emails)
- **effective_date**: Policy effective date (optional but needed for effective date emails)

**Invalid Data Handling**:
- Contacts with invalid/missing ZIP codes are skipped during processing
- State must be determinable from ZIP code for processing to occur

Campaign-specific data (such as rate increase dates) is stored separately in the campaign system rather than as contact fields, providing greater flexibility for managing multiple campaigns per contact.

### 3. Campaign System Architecture

The campaign system provides a flexible framework for managing various types of email communications beyond the standard anniversary-based emails. The system uses a two-tier architecture: **Campaign Types** (reusable configurations) and **Campaign Instances** (specific executions with templates and targeting).

#### 3.1 Campaign Type Model (Base Configuration)

Campaign types define reusable behavior patterns:
- **name**: Campaign type identifier (e.g., 'rate_increase', 'seasonal_promo', 'initial_blast')
- **respect_exclusion_windows**: Boolean flag controlling whether state exclusion rules apply
- **enable_followups**: Boolean flag controlling whether follow-up emails are generated
- **days_before_event**: Integer defining timing relative to trigger date (0 = immediate, 14 = two weeks before)
- **target_all_contacts**: Boolean flag for campaigns targeting entire contact base
- **priority**: Integer defining campaign precedence when multiple campaigns conflict

#### 3.2 Campaign Instance Model (Specific Executions)

Campaign instances represent specific executions of campaign types with unique templates and timing:
- **campaign_type**: Reference to the base campaign type
- **instance_name**: Unique identifier for this specific campaign (e.g., 'spring_2024_promo', 'rate_increase_q1_2024')
- **email_template**: Template identifier/name for email content
- **sms_template**: Template identifier/name for SMS content (optional)
- **active_start_date**: When this campaign instance becomes active for scheduling
- **active_end_date**: When this campaign instance stops being active
- **metadata**: JSON field for instance-specific configuration overrides

#### 3.3 Campaign Change Management

The system tracks all campaign changes for audit and rescheduling purposes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE campaign_change_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_instance_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    field_changed TEXT NOT NULL,
    old_value TEXT,
    new_value TEXT,
    changed_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    changed_by TEXT,
    requires_rescheduling BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_instance_id) REFERENCES campaign_instances(id)
);
```

When campaign dates change:
1. Log the change in campaign_change_log
2. Mark affected email schedules for reprocessing
3. Trigger scheduler to run for affected contacts

#### 3.4 Contact Campaign Targeting Model

Campaign targeting links contacts to specific campaign instances:
- **contact_id**: Reference to the target contact
- **campaign_instance_id**: Reference to the specific campaign instance
- **trigger_date**: The event date that triggers the campaign (e.g., rate change date)
- **status**: Current state ('pending', 'scheduled', 'sent', 'skipped')
- **metadata**: JSON field for contact-specific campaign data

#### 3.5 Campaign Examples with Multiple Instances

**Rate Increase Campaign Type:**
```yaml
campaign_type: rate_increase
respect_exclusion_windows: true
enable_followups: true
days_before_event: 14
target_all_contacts: false
priority: 1
```

**Multiple Rate Increase Instances:**
```yaml
# Q1 2024 Rate Increases
instance_name: rate_increase_q1_2024
email_template: rate_increase_standard_v2
sms_template: rate_increase_sms_v1
active_start_date: 2024-01-01
active_end_date: 2024-03-31

# Q2 2024 Rate Increases (different template)
instance_name: rate_increase_q2_2024
email_template: rate_increase_enhanced_v3
sms_template: rate_increase_sms_v2
active_start_date: 2024-04-01
active_end_date: 2024-06-30
```

**Seasonal Promotion Campaign Type:**
```yaml
campaign_type: seasonal_promo
respect_exclusion_windows: true
enable_followups: true
days_before_event: 7
target_all_contacts: false
priority: 5
```

**Multiple Seasonal Instances:**
```yaml
# Spring 2024 Enrollment
instance_name: spring_enrollment_2024
email_template: spring_promo_email
sms_template: spring_promo_sms
active_start_date: 2024-03-01
active_end_date: 2024-05-31

# Fall 2024 Enrollment
instance_name: fall_enrollment_2024
email_template: fall_promo_email
sms_template: fall_promo_sms
active_start_date: 2024-09-01
active_end_date: 2024-11-30
```

#### 3.6 Campaign Triggering Mechanisms

**Manual Targeting:**
- Administrator manually adds contacts to specific campaigns
- Useful for one-off communications or testing

**Automated Population:**
- Rate increases: Triggered when external systems update rate change data
- Regulatory notices: Triggered by compliance calendar events
- Policy updates: Triggered by carrier system integrations

**Bulk Import:**
- CSV uploads for large-scale campaign targeting
- API integrations for systematic campaign population

**Event-Driven:**
- Database triggers or application events automatically enroll contacts
- Real-time campaign activation based on contact behavior or external data

#### 3.7 Campaign Priority and Conflict Resolution

When multiple campaigns target the same contact on the same date:
1. **Priority-Based Selection**: Campaign with lowest priority number wins
2. **Exclusion Window Respect**: Campaigns respecting exclusion windows may be skipped while others proceed
3. **Follow-up Coordination**: Campaigns with follow-ups may influence scheduling of subsequent campaigns
4. **Volume Balancing**: Load balancing algorithms consider all campaign types together

### 4. State-Based Rules Engine

The system implements state-specific exclusion windows where no emails should be sent. These rules are categorized into three types:

#### 4.1 Birthday Window Rules
States with birthday-based exclusion windows:
- **CA**: 30 days before to 60 days after birthday
- **ID**: 0 days before to 63 days after birthday
- **KY**: 0 days before to 60 days after birthday
- **MD**: 0 days before to 30 days after birthday
- **NV**: 0 days before to 60 days after birthday (uses month start of birthday month)
- **OK**: 0 days before to 60 days after birthday
- **OR**: 0 days before to 31 days after birthday
- **VA**: 0 days before to 30 days after birthday

#### 4.2 Effective Date Window Rules
States with effective date-based exclusion windows:
- **MO**: 30 days before to 33 days after effective date anniversary

#### 4.3 Year-Round Exclusion Rules
States where no marketing emails are sent:
- **CT**: No emails sent year-round
- **MA**: No emails sent year-round
- **NY**: No emails sent year-round
- **WA**: No emails sent year-round

### 5. Exclusion Window Calculation

#### 5.1 Pre-Window Exclusion
All exclusion windows are extended by 60 days before their start date. This ensures emails are not sent just prior to the statutory exclusion window, so any new policy effective date won't be in the statutory exclusion window.

Example: If a birthday window starts on March 1st, the actual exclusion period begins on December 30th of the previous year (60 days before March 1st).

#### 5.2 Special Rules
- **Nevada (NV)**: Uses the first day of the birth month instead of the actual birth date for window calculation
- **Age 76+ Rule**: Some states may implement special handling for contacts aged 76 or older (year-round exclusion) -- none currently but this can happen in the future

#### 5.3 Window Spanning Years
Exclusion windows can span across calendar years. The system handles these cases by checking:
1. If the window crosses years (e.g., December to February)
2. Whether the current date falls in the first part (December) or second part (January-February)
(other approaches ok, just have to make sure we gracefully handle the case where the window spans years)

### 6. Email Scheduling Logic

#### 6.1 Anniversary Date Calculation
For both birthdays and effective dates:
1. Calculate the next anniversary from today
2. For February 29th dates, use February 28th in non-leap years
3. If this year's anniversary has passed, use next year's

#### 6.2 Email Date Calculation

**Anniversary-Based Emails:**
- Birthday emails: Anniversary date - 14 days (configurable)
- Effective date emails: Anniversary date - 30 days (configurable)
- AEP emails: September 15th of current year (configurable)
- Post-window emails: Day after exclusion window ends

**Campaign-Based Emails:**
- Campaign send date = trigger_date + days_before_event (from campaign configuration)
- If days_before_event is positive, sent before the trigger date
- If days_before_event is negative, sent after the trigger date
- If days_before_event is 0, sent on the trigger date

#### 6.3 Scheduling Process

**Anniversary-Based Email Scheduling:**
1. Determine contact's state from ZIP code
2. Check for state-specific rules
3. Calculate exclusion window (if applicable)
4. For each anniversary email type:
   - **Birthday**: If birthday is present, calculate anniversary date and scheduled send date
   - **Effective Date**: If effective_date is present, calculate anniversary date and scheduled send date
   - **AEP**: Calculate scheduled send date (September 15th)
   - For each calculated date, check if it falls within exclusion window
   - Mark as "skipped" if excluded, "pre-scheduled" if not
5. If any emails are skipped due to exclusion window:
   - Add a post-window email for the day after the window ends

**Campaign-Based Email Scheduling:**
1. Query active campaign instances (where current_date is between active_start_date and active_end_date)
2. For each active campaign instance, query target contacts from contact_campaigns table
3. For each contact-campaign instance combination:
   - Calculate send date based on trigger_date and campaign type's days_before_event
   - Check campaign type's respect_exclusion_windows flag
   - If flag is true, apply state exclusion window rules
   - If flag is false, schedule regardless of exclusion windows
   - Mark as "skipped" if excluded, "pre-scheduled" if not
   - Include email_template and sms_template from campaign instance
   - Set campaign_instance_id in email_schedules for template resolution
4. Apply campaign priority rules for conflicting send dates

**Complete Scheduling Process:**
1. **Clear Previous Schedules**: Delete all pre-scheduled and skipped emails for contacts being processed
2. **Process Anniversary Emails**: Calculate and schedule birthday, effective date, and AEP emails
3. **Process Campaign Emails**: Calculate and schedule all active campaign emails
4. **Apply Exclusion Windows**: Check state rules and mark excluded emails as skipped
5. **Add Post-Window Emails**: Create catch-up emails for after exclusion periods
6. **Apply Load Balancing**: Distribute emails evenly across days
7. **Enforce Frequency Limits**: Ensure contacts don't receive too many emails
8. **Combine and Sort**: Merge anniversary-based and campaign-based emails
9. Check if the contact has received too many emails in the last period_days days (do *not* do this for followup emails -- but we want to make sure that we don't send too many emails to the same contact in a short period of time. Campaign emails with higher priority take precedence over lower priority emails when frequency limits are reached.)

### 7. Load Balancing and Smoothing Logic

The system implements sophisticated load balancing to prevent email clustering and ensure even distribution of sending volume, particularly important for effective date emails that often cluster around the first of the month.

#### 7.1 Daily Volume Caps
- **Organizational Cap**: Maximum emails per day calculated as a percentage of total contacts (default: 7% of org contacts)
- **Effective Date Soft Limit**: Specific limit for effective date emails per day (default: 15 emails, or 30% of daily org cap, whichever is lower)
- **Over-Limit Detection**: Days exceeding 120% of daily cap are flagged for redistribution

#### 7.2 Effective Date Smoothing
Effective date emails are particularly prone to clustering because many policies have effective dates on the 1st of the month. The smoothing algorithm:

1. **Cluster Detection**: Counts how many effective date emails are scheduled for each day
2. **Threshold Application**: If a day exceeds the effective date soft limit, smoothing is applied
3. **Jitter Calculation**: Uses a deterministic hash of contact_id + event_type + event_year to calculate a jitter value
4. **Window Distribution**: Spreads emails across a configurable window (default: ±2 days from original date)
5. **Future Date Validation**: Ensures smoothed dates are never in the past

Example: If 50 effective date emails are scheduled for March 1st (exceeding the limit), they're redistributed across February 27th through March 3rd using deterministic jitter.

#### 7.3 Global Daily Cap Enforcement
When any day exceeds the organizational daily cap:

1. **Overflow Detection**: Identifies days with excessive email volume
2. **Next-Day Migration**: Moves excess emails to the following day if it has lower volume
3. **Cascade Prevention**: Ensures the next day doesn't become excessively overloaded
4. **Update Tracking**: Adjusts daily counts to reflect redistributed emails

#### 7.4 Catch-Up Email Distribution
For emails whose ideal send date has passed but the event is still in the future:

1. **Catch-Up Window**: Spreads catch-up emails across a configurable window (default: 7 days)
2. **Hash-Based Distribution**: Uses deterministic hashing to ensure consistent assignment
3. **Even Distribution**: Prevents all catch-up emails from being sent on the same day

#### 7.5 Performance Optimization for Scale

For handling up to 3 million contacts:

1. **Streaming Processing**:
   - Process contacts in chunks of 10,000
   - Use database cursors to avoid memory exhaustion
   - Calculate schedules in batches

2. **Optimized Indexes**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_state_birthday ON contacts(state, birthday);
   CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_state_effective ON contacts(state, effective_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_campaigns_active ON campaign_instances(active_start_date, active_end_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_schedules_lookup ON email_schedules(contact_id, email_type, scheduled_send_date);
   ```

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - Use prepared statements for all queries
   - Batch INSERTs up to 2,000 records per transaction
   - Use UPSERT operations where appropriate

#### 7.6 Configuration Parameters
```yaml
load_balancing:
  daily_send_percentage_cap: 0.07          # 7% of org contacts per day
  ed_daily_soft_limit: 15                  # Soft cap for ED emails per day
  ed_smoothing_window_days: 5              # ±2 days window for ED smoothing
  catch_up_spread_days: 7                  # Window for catch-up distribution
  overage_threshold: 1.2                   # 120% of cap triggers redistribution
```

#### 7.7 Benefits of Smoothing
- **Reduced Server Load**: Prevents overwhelming email infrastructure on peak days
- **Better Deliverability**: ISPs are less likely to throttle when volume is consistent
- **Improved User Experience**: Recipients don't receive large bursts of emails
- **Operational Efficiency**: Easier to manage sending infrastructure with predictable volume

### 8. Database Transaction Management

#### 8.1 Transaction Boundaries

All scheduling operations use explicit transaction boundaries:

```sql
BEGIN IMMEDIATE;  -- Prevent concurrent writes

-- 1. Create audit checkpoint
INSERT INTO scheduler_checkpoints (
    run_timestamp, 
    scheduler_run_id,
    contacts_checksum, 
    status
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'started');

-- 2. Clear existing schedules in batches
DELETE FROM email_schedules 
WHERE status IN ('pre-scheduled', 'skipped') 
AND contact_id IN (SELECT id FROM contacts LIMIT 10000);

-- 3. Process and insert new schedules
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO email_schedules (...) 
SELECT ... LIMIT 10000;

-- 4. Update checkpoint
UPDATE scheduler_checkpoints 
SET status = 'completed', 
    schedules_after_checksum = ?,
    contacts_processed = ?,
    emails_scheduled = ?,
    emails_skipped = ?,
    completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = ?;

COMMIT;
```

#### 8.2 Audit and Recovery

**Checkpoint Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE scheduler_checkpoints (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    run_timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
    scheduler_run_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    contacts_checksum TEXT NOT NULL,
    schedules_before_checksum TEXT,
    schedules_after_checksum TEXT,
    contacts_processed INTEGER,
    emails_scheduled INTEGER,
    emails_skipped INTEGER,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT,
    completed_at DATETIME
);
```

**Point-in-Time Backup Strategy**:
1. Create timestamped backup before processing
2. Verify backup integrity with PRAGMA integrity_check
3. Maintain rolling window of backups (7 days)
4. Store backups on persistent volume (fly.io volume mount)

### 9. Batch Processing

TBD -- no batching should be need for scheduling process, only for scheduling emails. However, it is helpful to have some sort of batch identifier so we can see in the database which when an email schedule was created or updated.

### 10. Database Operations

#### 10.1 Email Schedules Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_schedules (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    contact_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    email_type TEXT NOT NULL,                     -- 'birthday', 'campaign_rate_increase', 'followup_1_cold', etc.
    scheduled_send_date DATE NOT NULL,
    scheduled_send_time TIME DEFAULT '08:30:00',  -- configurable
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pre-scheduled',
    skip_reason TEXT,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 10,                  -- Lower numbers = higher priority
    campaign_instance_id INTEGER,                 -- For campaign-based emails, references campaign_instances.id
    email_template TEXT,                          -- Template to use for this email (from campaign instance or default)
    sms_template TEXT,                            -- Template to use for SMS (if applicable)
    scheduler_run_id TEXT,                        -- Added for audit trail
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    actual_send_datetime DATETIME,
    UNIQUE(contact_id, email_type, scheduled_send_date),
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_instance_id) REFERENCES campaign_instances(id),
    INDEX idx_scheduler_run (scheduler_run_id),
    INDEX idx_status_date (status, scheduled_send_date)
);
```

#### 10.2 Campaign System Tables
```sql
-- Base campaign type definitions (reusable patterns)
CREATE TABLE campaign_types (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                        -- 'rate_increase', 'seasonal_promo', etc.
    respect_exclusion_windows BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    enable_followups BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    days_before_event INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    target_all_contacts BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,                  -- Can this campaign type be used?
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Specific campaign instances (actual campaigns with templates)
CREATE TABLE campaign_instances (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    campaign_type TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- References campaign_types.name
    instance_name TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- 'spring_2024_promo', 'rate_increase_q1_2024'
    email_template TEXT,                          -- Template identifier for email sending system
    sms_template TEXT,                            -- Template identifier for SMS sending system
    active_start_date DATE,                       -- When this instance becomes active
    active_end_date DATE,                         -- When this instance expires
    metadata TEXT,                                -- JSON for instance-specific config overrides
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(campaign_type, instance_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_type) REFERENCES campaign_types(name)
);

-- Contact-campaign targeting associations (now references specific instances)
CREATE TABLE contact_campaigns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    contact_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    campaign_instance_id INTEGER NOT NULL,       -- References campaign_instances.id
    trigger_date DATE,                            -- When to send (for rate_increase, etc.)
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',               -- 'pending', 'scheduled', 'sent', 'skipped'
    metadata TEXT,                               -- JSON field for contact-specific data
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(contact_id, campaign_instance_id, trigger_date),
    FOREIGN KEY (campaign_instance_id) REFERENCES campaign_instances(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(id)
);
```

#### 10.3 Status Values
- **pre-scheduled**: Email is scheduled for future sending
- **skipped**: Email was skipped due to exclusion window
- **scheduled**: Email is queued for immediate sending
- **processing**: Email is being sent
- **sent**: Email was successfully sent
(The email scheduler we are building here will only use pre-scheduled and skipped statuses -- but will need to be able utilize the other statuses for the purpose of determining if an email is being sent too close to another email for the same contact.)

#### 10.4 Email Types
The email_type field supports the following values:

**Anniversary-Based Email Types:**
- **birthday**: Birthday-based emails (uses default birthday template)
- **effective_date**: Effective date anniversary emails (uses default effective date template)
- **aep**: Annual Enrollment Period emails (uses default AEP template)
- **post_window**: Post-exclusion window emails (uses default post-window template)

**Campaign-Based Email Types:**
- **campaign_{campaign_type}**: Dynamic email types based on campaign type (e.g., 'campaign_rate_increase', 'campaign_seasonal_promo')
  - Template determined by campaign_instance.email_template field
  - SMS template (if applicable) determined by campaign_instance.sms_template field

**Follow-up Email Types:**
- **followup_1_cold**: Cold follow-up emails (uses default cold follow-up template)
- **followup_2_clicked_no_hq**: Follow-up for contacts who clicked but didn't answer health questions
- **followup_3_hq_no_yes**: Follow-up for contacts who answered health questions with no conditions
- **followup_4_hq_with_yes**: Follow-up for contacts who answered health questions with conditions

#### 10.5 Template Resolution
Templates are resolved in the following order:
1. **Campaign-based emails**: Use email_template and sms_template from the campaign_instances table
2. **Anniversary-based emails**: Use predefined templates based on email_type
3. **Follow-up emails**: Use predefined follow-up templates based on email_type and parent email context

#### 10.6 Database Operations
1. **Clear existing schedules**: Removes all pre-scheduled and skipped entries for contacts being processed
2. **Campaign instance synchronization**: Updates contact_campaigns table based on external triggers and active campaign instances
3. **Template resolution**: Determines appropriate email/SMS templates based on campaign instance or email type
4. **Batch insert**: Uses INSERT OR IGNORE with ON CONFLICT to handle duplicates
5. **Transaction management**: Each batch is committed separately for reliability
6. **Campaign management**: CRUD operations for campaign types, instances, and contact targeting
7. **Instance lifecycle**: Automatic activation/deactivation based on active_start_date and active_end_date

### 11. Performance Optimizations

#### 11.1 Date-Based Contact Queries
For daily processing of birthdays and effective dates:
- Uses SQL date functions to find contacts by month and day
- Ignores year component for anniversary matching
- Supports batch processing of multiple dates

#### 11.2 Load Balancing and Smoothing
- Prevents email clustering through deterministic distribution algorithms
- Reduces peak infrastructure load by spreading volume across multiple days
- Maintains consistent daily sending volumes for better deliverability
- Uses hash-based jitter for predictable but distributed email scheduling

#### 11.3 Asynchronous Processing
(TBD -- this was a python-specific optimization, not sure if it's needed here)
- Database operations run in thread pool to avoid blocking
- Multiple batches can be processed concurrently
- Timing metrics track performance of each step

### 12. Configuration Management

#### 12.1 Timing Constants
```yaml
timing_constants:
  birthday_email_days_before: 14        # Days before birthday to send email
  effective_date_days_before: 30        # Days before effective date to send email
  pre_window_exclusion_days: 60         # Days to extend exclusion window backwards
```

#### 12.2 Campaign Configuration

**Campaign Types (Base Configurations):**
```yaml
campaign_types:
  rate_increase:
    respect_exclusion_windows: true
    enable_followups: true
    days_before_event: 14
    target_all_contacts: false
    priority: 1
    active: true
  
  seasonal_promo:
    respect_exclusion_windows: true
    enable_followups: true
    days_before_event: 7

```

**Campaign Instances (Specific Executions):**
```yaml
campaign_instances:
  # Multiple rate increase campaigns running simultaneously
  - campaign_type: rate_increase
    instance_name: rate_increase_q1_2024
    email_template: rate_increase_standard_v2
    sms_template: rate_increase_sms_v1
    active_start_date: 2024-01-01
    active_end_date: 2024-03-31
  
  - campaign_type: rate_increase
    instance_name: rate_increase_q2_2024
    email_template: rate_increase_enhanced_v3
    sms_template: rate_increase_sms_v2
    active_start_date: 2024-04-01
    active_end_date: 2024-06-30
  
  # Multiple seasonal promotions with different templates
  - campaign_type: seasonal_promo
    instance_name: spring_enrollment_2024
    email_template: spring_promo_email_v1
    sms_template: spring_promo_sms_v1
    active_start_date: 2024-03-01
    active_end_date: 2024-05-31
  
  - campaign_type: seasonal_promo
    instance_name: fall_enrollment_2024
    email_template: fall_promo_email_v2
    sms_template: fall_promo_sms_v2
    active_start_date: 2024-09-01
    active_end_date: 2024-11-30
```

#### 12.3 AEP Configuration
```yaml
aep_config:
  default_dates:
    - month: 9
      day: 15
  years: [2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027]
```

#### 12.4 State Rules Configuration
Stored in YAML format with:
- Rule type (birthday_window, effective_date_window, year_round)
- Window parameters (window_before, window_after)
- Special rules (use_month_start, age_76_plus)

#### 12.5 Versioned Configuration Management

All configuration stored in versioned format:

```sql
CREATE TABLE config_versions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    config_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    config_data TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
    valid_from DATETIME NOT NULL,
    valid_to DATETIME,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    created_by TEXT
);
```

This ensures configuration changes are tracked and can be rolled back if needed.

### 13. Error Handling and Recovery

- **Missing Required Fields**: Contacts missing email or zip_code are skipped, logged in audit table
- **Invalid ZIP Codes**: Skip contact, increment invalid_contact_count
- **Invalid Dates**: February 29th in non-leap years converts to February 28th
- **Transaction Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff, rollback entire batch
- **Partial Processing**: Track progress in checkpoints for resumability
- **Batch Failures**: Individual batch rollback without affecting other batches
- **Database Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### 14. Monitoring and Observability

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Processing time per batch
- Emails scheduled/skipped per run
- Daily volume distribution
- Exclusion window hit rate
- Campaign effectiveness metrics
- Contacts fetched and processed
- Performance timing for each operation

**Health Checks**:
- Database connection status
- Last successful run timestamp
- Pending schedule backlog
- Error rate thresholds

**Logging and Monitoring**:
The system provides detailed logging for:
- Contacts fetched and processed
- Emails scheduled, skipped, or sent
- Exclusion window calculations
- Performance timing for each operation
- Error conditions with full stack traces

### 15. Key Business Rules Summary

1. **No emails during exclusion windows**: Strictly enforced based on state rules
2. **Post-window catch-up**: Ensures contacts receive communication after exclusion periods
3. **Anniversary-based scheduling**: Emails tied to recurring annual dates
4. **State compliance**: Different rules for different states based on regulations
5. **Batch reliability**: Failed batches don't affect successful ones
6. **Idempotency**: Re-running scheduling won't create duplicates (INSERT OR IGNORE)
7. **Date handling**: Consistent handling of leap years and month-end dates

### 16. Integration Points

- **ZIP to State Mapping**: Uses pre-loaded ZIP code database
- **Contact Rules Engine**: Modular engine for applying state-specific rules
- **Email/SMS Sending**: Integrates with SendGrid (email) and Twilio (SMS)
- **Webhook Handling**: Processes delivery notifications from email/SMS providers

### 17. Data Flow

1. **Daily Scheduling**:
   - Fetch contacts with birthdays/effective dates in target window
   - Apply state rules and calculate exclusion windows
   - Generate email schedules
   - Store in database with appropriate status

2. **Email Sending**:
(handled separately)
   - Query for emails due today with status 'pre-scheduled'
   - Send via appropriate channel (email/SMS)
   - Update status and track delivery

3. **Webhook Processing**:
(handled separately)
   - Receive delivery notifications
   - Update email status
   - Log delivery metrics

### 18. Follow-up Email Scheduling

The system implements an intelligent follow-up scheduling algorithm that:
1. Identifies initial emails (anniversary-based: birthday, effective_date, aep, post_window; campaign-based: any campaign with enable_followups=true) that need follow-ups
2. Schedules follow-ups 2 days after the initial email was sent (configurable)
3. Determines the appropriate follow-up template based on user behavior
4. Respects campaign-specific follow-up settings

#### 18.1 Follow-up Email Types

The system uses four follow-up templates based on user engagement hierarchy:
1. **followup_4_hq_with_yes**: Contact answered health questions with medical conditions (highest priority)
2. **followup_3_hq_no_yes**: Contact answered health questions with no medical conditions
3. **followup_2_clicked_no_hq**: Contact clicked a link but didn't answer health questions
4. **followup_1_cold**: Contact didn't click or answer health questions (lowest priority)

#### 18.2 Follow-up Scheduling Process

1. **Identify Eligible Emails**:
   - Find emails with status 'sent' or 'delivered'
   - Filter for anniversary-based email types (birthday, effective_date, aep, post_window)
   - Filter for campaign-based email types where the campaign has enable_followups=true
   - Look back 35 days by default
   - Exclude contacts that already have follow-ups scheduled or sent

2. **Determine Follow-up Type**:
   - Check if contact clicked links (tracking_clicks table)
   - Check if contact answered health questions (contact_events table with event_type='eligibility_answered')
   - Evaluate medical conditions from metadata (has_medical_conditions flag or main_questions_yes_count)
   - Select highest applicable follow-up type based on behavior

3. **Schedule Follow-up**:
   - Default: 2 days after initial email (configurable)
   - If already past due, schedule for tomorrow
   - Include metadata tracking initial email details and behavior analysis
   - Support for SMS follow-ups if phone number available
   - Inherit priority from original campaign (if campaign-based) or use default priority (if anniversary-based)

#### 18.3 Campaign-Specific Follow-up Rules

- **Campaign Enable/Disable**: Only campaigns with enable_followups=true generate follow-up emails
- **Priority Inheritance**: Follow-up emails inherit the priority of their parent campaign
- **Exclusion Window Respect**: Follow-ups always respect exclusion windows regardless of parent campaign settings
- **Metadata Tracking**: Follow-ups include campaign_name for traceability when generated from campaign emails

#### 18.4 Active Follow-up Scheduler Features

- **Continual Re-evaluation**: Can update follow-up type if user behavior changes before sending
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple contacts in parallel for performance
- **Idempotent**: Tracks processed emails to avoid duplicates
- **Metadata Tracking**: Stores decision rationale and behavior details
- **Campaign-Aware**: Handles both anniversary-based and campaign-based initial emails

#### 18.5 Database Schema for Follow-ups

Follow-ups use the same email_schedules table with:
- email_type: 'followup_1_cold', 'followup_2_clicked_no_hq', etc.
- metadata: JSON containing initial_comm_log_id, initial_email_type, followup_behavior details
- campaign_instance_id: Set to parent campaign instance ID for campaign-based follow-ups, null for anniversary-based
- email_template: Default follow-up template unless overridden by campaign instance metadata
- sms_template: Default follow-up SMS template unless overridden by campaign instance metadata
- priority: Inherited from parent email/campaign
- event_year/month/day: Inherited from initial email for birthday/effective_date follow-ups

#### 18.6 Performance Optimizations

- Batch fetching of contact data, click data, and health question events using sql queries
- Parallel processing using multiprocessing pool (TBD -- not sure if this is needed here)
- Large batch SQL execution (up to 2000 statements per transaction)
- Campaign configuration caching to avoid repeated database queries

### 19. Campaign System Benefits and Implementation Notes

The abstract campaign system provides significant advantages over individual email type implementations:

#### 19.1 Operational Benefits
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: New campaign types require only configuration, not code changes
- **Unified Management**: All campaign types use the same scheduling, tracking, and reporting infrastructure
- **Flexible Targeting**: Campaigns can target all contacts or specific subsets based on various criteria
- **Configurable Compliance**: Per-campaign control over exclusion window compliance and follow-up generation

#### 19.2 Business Benefits
- **Rapid Campaign Deployment**: New marketing initiatives can be launched quickly through configuration
- **A/B Testing Support**: Multiple campaign configurations can be tested simultaneously
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: Campaigns can be configured to meet different compliance requirements
- **Scalable Architecture**: System can handle unlimited campaign types without performance degradation

#### 19.3 Implementation Considerations
- **Database Migration**: Existing scheduled_rate_increase emails should be migrated to the campaign instance system
- **Template Management**: Email and SMS sending systems must integrate with campaign instance template resolution
- **Multiple Instance Support**: Scheduler must handle multiple active instances of the same campaign type simultaneously
- **Instance Lifecycle**: Automatic activation/deactivation of campaign instances based on date ranges
- **Configuration Management**: Campaign configurations should be version-controlled and auditable
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Campaign performance metrics should be tracked per instance and campaign type
- **API Integration**: External systems should be able to create and manage campaign instances programmatically

#### 19.4 Migration Strategy
1. **Create Campaign Type Definitions**: Set up base campaign types (rate_increase, initial_blast, seasonal_promo) in the campaign_types table
2. **Create Initial Campaign Instances**: Set up specific campaign instances with templates and date ranges
3. **Migrate Existing Data**: Convert existing rate increase schedules to campaign instance-based schedules
4. **Integrate Template Resolution**: Update email/SMS sending systems to use template information from email_schedules table
5. **Update Scheduling Logic**: Modify scheduler to handle both anniversary-based and campaign instance-based emails
6. **Test Multiple Instance Support**: Ensure system can handle multiple simultaneous instances of the same campaign type
7. **Deploy Incrementally**: Roll out campaign instance system alongside existing functionality before full cutover

This comprehensive campaign instance-aware business logic ensures reliable, compliant, and efficient email scheduling across multiple states with varying regulations, while providing the flexibility to rapidly deploy multiple simultaneous campaigns with different templates and targeting criteria.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an OCaml-based email scheduling system that manages automated email and SMS campaigns. The system handles:
- Anniversary-based emails (birthdays, policy effective dates, AEP, post-window)
- Campaign-based emails with flexible configuration
- State-specific exclusion windows and regulatory compliance
- Processing up to 3 million contacts efficiently
- Complex date calculations in Central Time (CT)

The project uses Dune as its build system and follows OCaml best practices.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
# Build the project
dune build

# Run the main executable
dune exec scheduler

# Run tests
dune test

# Run tests with coverage
dune test --instrument-with bisect_ppx

# Build documentation
dune build @doc

# Clean build artifacts
dune clean

# Format code (if ocamlformat is configured)
dune build @fmt --auto-promote

# Check code formatting
dune build @fmt
```

## Project Architecture

### Module Structure
The implementation should follow this architecture as outlined in `prompt.md`:

- **lib/domain/** - Core domain types and business entities
  - `types.ml` - Core type definitions (states, email types, contacts)
  - `contact.ml` - Contact operations
  - `campaign.ml` - Campaign types and logic
  - `email_schedule.ml` - Schedule types

- **lib/rules/** - Business rule engine
  - `state_rules.ml` - State-specific exclusion windows
  - `exclusion_window.ml` - Exclusion window calculations
  - `dsl.ml` - Domain-specific language for rules

- **lib/scheduling/** - Core scheduling logic
  - `date_calc.ml` - Date calculations and timezone handling
  - `scheduler.ml` - Main scheduling algorithm
  - `load_balancer.ml` - Load distribution logic

- **lib/persistence/** - Database layer
  - `database.ml` - Database operations using Caqti
  - `queries.ml` - SQL query definitions
  - `migrations.ml` - Schema migrations

### Key Dependencies
The project uses these OCaml libraries (defined in dune-project):
- `sqlite3` and `caqti` for database access
- `lwt` for asynchronous programming
- `ptime` and `timedesc` for date/time handling
- `yojson` for JSON configuration
- `logs` for structured logging
- `alcotest` for testing

### Database Schema
The system works with an SQLite database (`org-206.sqlite3`) containing:
- `contacts` table with customer information
- `email_schedules` table for scheduling
- Campaign and tracking tables as defined in `business_logic.md`

## Important Business Rules

1. **Time Zone**: All operations use Central Time (CT)
2. **State Exclusions**: Complex exclusion windows per state (see `business_logic.md`)
3. **Email Priorities**: Strict priority system with state exclusions taking precedence
4. **Anniversary Timing**: 
   - Birthday emails: 14 days before
   - Effective date emails: 30 days before
   - AEP emails: September annually
5. **Campaign System**: Two-tier architecture with campaign types and instances

## Development Guidelines

1. **Type Safety**: Use OCaml's type system extensively - create variants for states, email types, and statuses
2. **Error Handling**: Use Result types for operations that can fail
3. **Performance**: Implement streaming/batching for large contact lists (10k batch size)
4. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for date calculations and state rules
5. **Logging**: Use structured logging for audit trails

## Current Implementation Status

The project is currently scaffolded with:
- Basic Dune configuration
- Empty library structure in `lib/`
- Placeholder main executable in `bin/main.ml`
- Empty test file in `test/test_scheduler.ml`

The actual implementation of the email scheduling logic needs to be built following the specifications in `business_logic.md` and the architecture outlined in `prompt.md`.

Introduction to opam Switches · OCaml Documentation
Introduction to opam Switches
OCaml's package manager, opam, introduces the concept of a switch, which is an isolated OCaml environment. These switches often cause confusion amongst OCaml newcomers, so this document aims to provide a better understanding of opam switches and their usage for managing dependencies and project-specific configurations.

Opam is designed to manage multiple concurrent installation prefixes called "switches." Similar to Python's virtualenv, an opam switch is a tool that creates isolated environments. They are independent of each other and have their own set of installed packages, repositories, and configuration options. Switches also have their own OCaml compiler, libraries, and binaries. This enables you to have multiple compiler versions available at once.

Listing Switches
The command below will display the opam switches that are configured on your system. After completing installation of OCaml, such as outlined in Installing OCaml, a single switch called default will have been created. At that point, listing the switches will only show that switch.

$ opam switch list
#   switch   compiler      description
->  default  ocaml.4.13.1  default
Creating a New Switch
To create a new opam switch, you can use the opam switch command followed by the desired switch name and an optional OCaml compiler version. For example, to create a switch named "my_project" with a specific OCaml compiler version, use:

opam switch create my_project <compiler-version>
Replace <compiler-version> with the version of the OCaml compiler you want to use. If you don't specify a compiler version, opam will choose the default version.

Next, activate your new switch. This will set it as the currently selected switch, so any OCaml-related operations will use this stall OCaml packages, libraries, and dependencies specific to this switch without affecting other switches or the system-wide OCaml environment.

Typespam switch, it's global by default unless otherwise configured. You can also explicitly select a global switch by using the opam switch command with the --global flag.

Opam's system switch is a global switch that is associated with the OCaml installation on your operating system. The system switch is accessible across the entire system.

Local Switches
A local opam switch, on the other hand, is tied to a specific project directory. It is created within the project's directory or subdirectory, so you can manage OCaml and its dependencies in the context of that particular project only.

In other words, local switches provide isolation for project-specific OCaml environments, allowing you to define and manage the specific compiler version and packages needed for a particular project.

They are particularly useful when you want to ensure that a project uses specific versions of OCaml and its packages without interfering with the system-wide or other project-specific OCaml installations.

Lwitch> command-line flag to specify a switch for a single command.<switch> environment variable to choose a switch within a single shell session. Use eval $(opam env --switch <switch>) to set the shell environment accordingly.

Command-Line Flag: Use the --switch <sry that contains a switch, it will be automatically selected. Local switches are external to the opam root.

Environment Variable: Set the OPAMSWITCH=he command opam switch <switch>. Opam will use this switch for all subsequent commands, unless overridden.

Local Selection: When working in a directost package-related commands in opam operate within the context of a selected switch. You can select a switch in several ways:

Global Selection: Use tocal switches are automatically selected based on the current working directory. When you navigate into a directory with an associated local switch, opam uses that switch for any OCaml-related operations within that directory.

Selecting a Switch
Moften used for system-wide OCaml installations and are not tied to a particular project or directory. A switch is created and configured at the system level and is typically used to manage OCaml and its ecosystem on a global scale.

When creating an o of Switches
Global Switches
Global switches are owitch. You can activate it by running:

opam switch my_project
Replace my_project with the name of your new switch.

Confirm you've activated it by running:

opam switch
If the output is the name of your new switch, you've successfully activated it! Now you can use it for your OCaml projects and ins

  - Anniversary calculations
- **`lib/scheduling/date_calc.ml`** - Core scheduling calculations:
  - Exclusion window checking with pre-buffer logic
  - Load balancing jitter calculations
  - Central Time scheduling support

### **Phase 2: State Rules Engine and DSL** ✅
- **`lib/rules/dsl.ml`** - Domain-specific language for exclusion rules:
  - Birthday window definitions
  - Effective date window definitions  
  - Year-round exclusion support
  - State-specific rule mapping
- **`lib/rules/exclusion_window.ml`** - Complete exclusion logic:
  - Birthday exclusion checking
  - Effective date exclusion checking
  - Year-round exclusion enforcement
  - Post-window date calculations

### **Core Infrastructure** ✅
- **`lib/domain/contact.ml`** - Contact operations:
  - Email validation (regex-based)
  - ZIP code format validation
  - Contact state updating
  - Scheduling eligibility checking
- **`lib/utils/zip_data.ml`** - ZIP code integration:
  - JSON parsing of zipData.json (39,456 ZIP codes loaded)
  - Accurate ZIP to state mapping
  - Validation and lookup functions
- **`lib/utils/config.ml`** - Configuration management:
  - Default timing parameters
  - JSON configuration loading

### **Accurate State-Based Exclusions**
The system correctly implements complex exclusion rules:
- **California**: 30 days before birthday + 60-day buffer + 60 days after birthday
- **Nevada**: Month-start based exclusion windows  
- **Year-round states**: CT, MA, NY, WA (no emails allowed)
- **No exclusion states**: Other states with no specific restrictions

### **Real ZIP Code Integration**
- Successfully loads 39,456 ZIP codes from zipData.json
- Accurate state determination (90210 → CA, 10001 → NY, etc.)
- Handles edge cases and invalid ZIP codes gracefully

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Domain Types (types.ml)

```ocaml
(* Start with comprehensive type definitions *)
module Types = struct
  (* US States - use variant type for compile-time safety *)
  type state = 
    | CA | CT | ID | KY | MA | MD | MO | NV 
    | NY | OK | OR | VA | WA 
    | Other of string

  (* Email types with clear discrimination *)
  type anniversary_email = 
    | Birthday
    | EffectiveDate
    | AEP
    | PostWindow

  type campaign_email = {
    campaign_type: string;
    instance_id: int;
    respect_exclusions: bool;
    days_before_event: int;
    priority: int;
  }

  type email_type =
    | Anniversary of anniversary_email
    | Campaign of campaign_email
    | Followup of followup_type

  and followup_type =
    | Cold
    | ClickedNoHQ
    | HQNoYes
    | HQWithYes

  (* Schedule status *)
  type schedule_status =
    | PreScheduled
    | Skipped of string  (* reason *)
    | Scheduled
    | Processing
    | Sent

  (* Contact type *)
  type contact = {
    id: int;
    email: string;
    zip_code: string option;
    state: state option;
    birthday: Ptime.date option;
    effective_date: Ptime.date option;
  }

  (* Email schedule *)
  type email_schedule = {
    contact_id: int;
    email_type: email_type;
    scheduled_date: Ptime.date;
    scheduled_time: Ptime.time;
    status: schedule_status;
    priority: int;
    template_id: string option;
    campaign_instance_id: int option;
    scheduler_run_id: string;
  }
end
```

### 2. State Rules DSL (dsl.ml)

```ocaml
(* Create a DSL for expressing exclusion rules *)
module RuleDSL = struct
  type window = {
    before_days: int;
    after_days: int;
    use_month_start: bool;
  }

  type rule =
    | BirthdayWindow of window
    | EffectiveDateWindow of window
    | YearRoundExclusion
    | NoExclusion

  (* DSL functions for building rules *)
  let birthday_window ~before ~after ?(use_month_start=false) () =
    BirthdayWindow { before_days = before; after_days = after; use_month_start }

  let effective_date_window ~before ~after =
    EffectiveDateWindow { before_days = before; after_days = after }

  let year_round = YearRoundExclusion
  let no_exclusion = NoExclusion

  (* State rule definitions using the DSL *)
  let rules_for_state = function
    | CA -> birthday_window ~before:30 ~after:60 ()
    | ID -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:63 ()
    | KY -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:60 ()
    | MD -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:30 ()
    | NV -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:60 ~use_month_start:true ()
    | OK -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:60 ()
    | OR -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:31 ()
    | VA -> birthday_window ~before:0 ~after:30 ()
    | MO -> effective_date_window ~before:30 ~after:33
    | CT | MA | NY | WA -> year_round
    | Other _ -> no_exclusion
end
```

### 3. Date Calculations (date_calc.ml)

```ocaml
module DateCalc = struct
  open Ptime

  (* Add pre-window exclusion buffer *)
  let pre_window_buffer_days = 60

  (* Calculate next anniversary from today *)
  let next_anniversary (today: date) (event_date: date) : date =
    (* Implementation should handle:
       - Year wraparound
       - February 29th in non-leap years
       - Past anniversaries this year
    *)

  (* Check if date falls within exclusion window *)
  let in_exclusion_window (check_date: date) (window: RuleDSL.window) (anchor_date: date) : bool =
    (* Implementation should handle:
       - Windows spanning year boundaries
       - Nevada's month-start rule
       - Pre-window buffer extension
    *)

  (* Calculate jitter for load balancing *)
  let calculate_jitter ~contact_id ~event_type ~year ~window_days : int =
    (* Use deterministic hash for consistent distribution *)
    let hash_input = Printf.sprintf "%d-%s-%d" contact_id event_type year in
    (Hashtbl.hash hash_input) mod window_days - (window_days / 2)
end
```

### 4. Streaming Architecture (scheduler.ml)

```ocaml
module Scheduler = struct
  open Lwt.Syntax

  (* Process contacts in streaming fashion *)
  let schedule_emails_streaming ~db ~config ~run_id =
    let chunk_size = 10_000 in
    
    let rec process_chunk offset =
      let* contacts = Database.fetch_contacts_batch ~offset ~limit:chunk_size db in
      match contacts with
      | [] -> Lwt.return_unit
      | batch ->
          let* schedules = 
            batch
            |> Lwt_list.map_p (calculate_schedules ~config ~run_id)
            |> Lwt.map List.concat
          in
          
          let* balanced_schedules = LoadBalancer.distribute_schedules schedules config in
          let* () = Database.insert_schedules db balanced_schedules in
          
          (* Update checkpoint *)
          let* () = Audit.update_checkpoint ~run_id ~contacts_processed:chunk_size db in
          
          process_chunk (offset + chunk_size)
    in
    
    process_chunk 0
end
```

### 5. Database Operations (database.ml)

```ocaml
module Database = struct
  open Caqti_request.Infix
  open Caqti_type.Std

  (* Type-safe queries using Caqti *)
  module Q = struct
    let fetch_contacts_batch =
      (int2 ->* Caqti_type.(tup4 int string (option string) (option ptime_date)))
      "SELECT id, email, zip_code, birthday FROM contacts \
       WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id LIMIT ?"

    let clear_existing_schedules =
      (string ->. unit)
      "DELETE FROM email_schedules \
       WHERE scheduler_run_id != ? \
       AND status IN ('pre-scheduled', 'skipped')"

    let insert_schedule =
      (Caqti_type.(tup6 int string ptime_date string int string) ->. unit)
      "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO email_schedules \
       (contact_id, email_type, scheduled_send_date, status, priority, scheduler_run_id) \
       VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
  end

  (* Connection pool management *)
  let with_transaction (db: Caqti_lwt.connection) f =
    let open Lwt.Syntax in
    let* () = Caqti_lwt.start db in
    Lwt.catch
      (fun () ->
        let* result = f () in
        let* () = Caqti_lwt.commit db in
        Lwt.return result)
      (fun exn ->
        let* () = Caqti_lwt.rollback db in
        Lwt.fail exn)
end
```

### 6. Load Balancing (load_balancer.ml)

```ocaml
module LoadBalancer = struct
  type daily_stats = {
    date: Ptime.date;
    total_count: int;
    ed_count: int;
  }

  (* Implement smoothing algorithm *)
  let smooth_effective_dates schedules config =
    (* Group by date and identify clusters *)
    let daily_counts = count_by_date schedules in
    
    (* Apply jitter to dates over threshold *)
    List.map (fun schedule ->
      match schedule.email_type with
      | Anniversary EffectiveDate when is_over_threshold daily_counts schedule.scheduled_date ->
          apply_jitter schedule config
      | _ -> schedule
    ) schedules
end
```

### 7. Testing Strategy

```ocaml
(* test/test_exclusion_windows.ml *)
open Alcotest

let test_california_birthday_window () =
  let contact = { default_contact with state = Some CA; birthday = Some test_date } in
  let result = calculate_exclusion_window contact in
  check bool "CA birthday window" true (is_excluded result)

let test_year_boundary_window () =
  (* Test window spanning Dec 15 - Jan 15 *)
  let dec_date = make_date 2024 12 20 in
  let jan_date = make_date 2025 1 10 in
  (* Both should be in exclusion window *)

let test_suite = [
  "Exclusion Windows", [
    test_case "California birthday" `Quick test_california_birthday_window;
    test_case "Year boundary" `Quick test_year_boundary_window;
  ];
]
```

### 8. Performance Requirements

1. **Memory Usage**: Stream processing to keep memory under 1GB for 3M contacts
2. **Processing Speed**: Target 100k contacts/minute
3. **Database Optimization**: 
   - Use prepared statements
   - Batch inserts (2000 records/transaction)
   - Proper indexes on all query columns

### 9. Error Handling

```ocaml
type scheduler_error =
  | DatabaseError of string
  | InvalidContactData of { contact_id: int; reason: string }
  | ConfigurationError of string
  | UnexpectedError of exn

let handle_error = function
  | DatabaseError msg -> 
      Log.err (fun m -> m "Database error: %s" msg);
      (* Implement retry logic *)
  | InvalidContactData { contact_id; reason } ->
      Log.warn (fun m -> m "Skipping contact %d: %s" contact_id reason);
      (* Continue processing *)
  | ConfigurationError msg ->
      Log.err (fun m -> m "Configuration error: %s" msg);
      (* Halt processing *)
  | UnexpectedError exn ->
      Log.err (fun m -> m "Unexpected error: %s" (Printexc.to_string exn));
      (* Log and re-raise *)
```

### 10. Deployment Configuration

```yaml
# config/scheduler.yaml
scheduler:
  timezone: "America/Chicago"
  batch_size: 10000
  max_memory_mb: 1024
  
timing:
  birthday_days_before: 14
  effective_date_days_before: 30
  pre_window_buffer: 60
  followup_delay_days: 2
  
load_balancing:
  daily_cap_percentage: 0.07
  ed_soft_limit: 15
  smoothing_window: 5
  
database:
  path: "org-206.sqlite3"
  backup_dir: "./backups"
  backup_retention_days: 7
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Core domain types and date calculations
2. **Phase 2**: State rules engine and DSL
3. **Phase 3**: Basic scheduling without load balancing
4. **Phase 4**: Add load balancing and smoothing
5. **Phase 5**: Campaign system integration
6. **Phase 6**: Audit trail and recovery mechanisms
7. **Phase 7**: Performance optimization and testing
8. **Phase 8**: Monitoring and observability

## Success Criteria

1. All date calculations handle edge cases correctly
2. State exclusion rules are properly enforced
3. System can process 3M contacts in under 3 minutes
4. Memory usage stays under 1GB (if possible -- would have more memory if needed to reduce time)
5. Full audit trail for compliance
6. 100% test coverage for business logic
7. Zero data loss on crashes (transactional safety)

## Additional Notes

- Use phantom types for additional type safety where appropriate
- Consider using GADTs for the email type hierarchy
- Implement property-based testing for date calculations
- Use Lwt for concurrent I/O operations
- Profile memory usage with large datasets
- Consider using Flambda for additional optimizations

Remember: The goal is to create a maintainable, type-safe system that makes invalid states unrepresentable at compile time.

A Tour of OCaml · OCaml Documentation
A Tour of OCaml
This tutorial introduces OCaml's basic features: values, expressions, lists, functions, pattern matching, and more.

No OCaml or any functional programming knowledge is required; however, it is assumed the reader has some basic software development knowledge. Please ensure you've installed OCaml and set up the environment, as described on the Install OCaml page.

We recommend that you execute the examples we provide, and to experiment with them, to get a feel for coding in OCaml. To do this, you can use UTop (Universal Toplevel).

UTop allows users to interact with OCaml by reading and evaluating OCaml phrases, like expressions or value definitions, and printing the result on the screen. Use the utop command to run UTop. Exit it by pressing Ctrl+D. For more information, you can read the Introduction to the OCaml Toplevel.

Some of the examples in this tour include comments. Comments in OCaml start with (* and end with *) and can be nested. Since they are ignored by OCaml, they can be used anywhere whitespace is permitted. When entering the code below into UTop, the comments can be left out. Here are some examples:

(* Here is a comment *)
(* Outside of the nested comment is still a comment. (* Here is a nested comment *) Outside of the nested comment again. *)
# 50 + (* A comment in between parts of an expression *) 50;;
- : int = 100
Expressions and Definitions
Let's start with a simple expression:

# 50 * 50;;
- : int = 2500
In OCaml, everything has a value, and every value has a type. The above example says, “50 * 50 is an expression that has type int (integer) and evaluates to 2500.” Since it is an anonymous expression, the character - appears instead of a n toplevel to evaluate and print the result of the given phrase.

Here are examples of other primitive values possible to give names to values that can be updated. In OCaml, this is called a reference and will ions. The ternary conditional operator and the if … then … else … are the same. Also note parentheses are not needed here, which is often the case in OCaml.
                                                           : int = 5280
This is discussed further in odoc forest between the strings "hi" and "hello".” OCaml also has a double equal operator ==, which stands for physical equality, but it is not used in this tutorial. The operator <> is the negation of =, while != is the negation of ==.
                                            since everything is a value, functions are values too. Functions are defined using the let keyword:
                                                   square is applied to 50, it evaluates x * x into 50 * 50, which leads to 2500.
                                                           n value can't be displayed, which is why <fun> is printed instead.
                                                                  ed parameters. Labels are useful when a function h
# String.ends_with;;                                                     as several parameters of the same type; naming arguments allows to guess their purpose. Above, ~suffix:"less" indicates "less" is passed as labelled argument suffix. Labelled arguments are detailed in the Labelled Arguments tutorial.
e:t : string -> string -> string = <fun>le to only pass a to cat without passing bnction List.map can be applied on any kind of list. Here it is given a list of integers, but it could be a list of floats, strings, or anything. This is known as polymorphism. The List.map function isnts have the same type of its input.
Output list elements have the same type of its output.
Side-Effects and the unit Type
Performing operating systeT to proceed, and the function print_endline doesn't have any meaningful data to return. Indicating this absence of data is the role of the unit type, ing taking place when executing a function but which does not appear in the function type. This is called a side-effect and does not stop at I/O. The unit type is often used to indicate the presence of side-effects, although it's not always the case.range 2 5;;
- : int list = [2; 3; 4; 5]
As indicated by its type int -> int -> int list, the function range takes two integers as arguments and returns a list of integers as result. The first int parameter, lo, is the range's lower bound; the second int parameter, hi, is the higher bound. If lo > hi, the empty range is returned. That's the first branch of the if … then … else expression. Otherwise, the lo value is prepended to the list created by calling range itself; this is recursion. Prepending is achieved using ::, the cons operator in OCaml. It constructs a new list by adding an element at the front of an existing list. Progress is made at each call; since lo has just been prepended at : 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: range 6 5
=> 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: rence
OCaml has floating-point values of type floalues can be automatically converted from one type into another. This includes implicit type conversion and promotion. For example, in such a language, if you write 1 + 2.5, the first argument (an integer) is promoted to a floating point number, makintegers, so it can't be used with the 2.5 float. In the second example, +. is intended to be used with floats, so it can't be used with the 1 integer.

In OCaml you need to explicitly convert the integ= 3.5
There are several reasons why OCaml requires explicit conversions. Most importantly, it enables types to be worked out automatically. OCaml's type inference algorithm computes a type for each expression and requires very little annotation, in comparison to other languages. Arguably, this saveslse; false; true]

# [[1; 2]; [3]; [4; 5; 6]];;
- : int list list = [[1; 2]; [3]; [4; 5; 6]]
The ex    | x :: v -> x + sum v;;
val sum : int list ->    | [] -> 0
    | _ :: v -> 1 + length v;; (* _  = 1
This function operates not just on lists of integers but on any kind of list. It is a polymorphic function. Its type indicates input of type 'a list where 'a is a type variable standing for any type. The empty list pattern [] can be of any element type. So the _ :: v pattern, as the value at the head of the list, is irrelevant because the _ pattern indicates it is not inspected. Since both patterns must be of the same type, the typing algorithm infers the 'a list -> int type.

Defining a Hilist -> 'b list = <fun>

# map square [1; 2; 3; 4;];;
- : int list = [1; 4; 9; 16]
Pattern Matching, Cont'd
Pattern matching isn't limited to lists. Any kind of data can be inspected using it, except functions. Patterns are expressions that are compared to an inspected value. It could be performed using if … then … else …, but pattern matching is more convenient. Here is an example using the option data type that will be detailed in the Modules and the Standard Library section.

# #show option;;a option option-> 'a option = <fun>
The inspected value is opt of type option. It is compared against the patterns from top to bottom. If opt is the None option, it is a match with the first pattern. If opt is the Some None option, it's a match with the second pattern. If opt is a double-wrapped option with a value, it's a match with the third pattern. Patterns can introduce names, just as let do al g' : string -> int = <fun>
The underscore symboes
Tuples are fixed-length collections of elements [Red; Blue; Red];;
- : primary_colour list = [Red; Blue; Red]
Here is the definition of a variant tange of int * int;;
type page_range = All | Current | Range of int * int
In the previous definitions, the capitalised identifiers are called constructors. They allow the creation of variant values. This is unrelated to object-oriented programming.

A> page_range -> bool = <fun>
Like a function, a vaype 'a list = [] | (::) of 'a * 'a list
As previouments of several types together. However, each element is given a name. Like variant types, records types must be defined before being used. Here are examples of a record type, a value, access to a component, and pattern matching on the same record.
 ard : person = {first_name = "Gérard"; surname = "Huet"; age = 76}
When defining gerard, no type needs to be declared. The type checker will search for a record which has exactly three fields with matching names and types. Note that there are no typing relationships between records. It is not possible to declare a record type that extends another by adding fields. Record type search will succeed in with
    | { age = x; _ } -> 13 <= x && x <= 19;eenager gerard;;

Here, the patterutable State
OCaml supports imperative programming. Usually, the let … = … syntax does not define variables, it defines constants. However, mutable variables exist in OCaml. They are called references. Here's how we create a reference to an integer:

# let r = ref 0;;
val r : int ref = {contents = #as used earlier in this section is also part of a 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list = <fun>

# List.map (funtutorial, OCaml was used interactively. The next tutorial, Your First OCaml Program, shows you how to write OCaml files, how to compile them, and how to kickstart a project.w for efficient separate compilation. This is illustrated in the next tutorial.

Conclusion
In this is illustrates the first feature of the OCaml module system. It provides a means to separate concerns by preventing name clashes. Two functions having different type may have the same name if they are provided by different modules.

When the option value provided containcation, only pass fun x -> x * x. Check the type of the resulting function.

Excn { age = x; _ } is typed with the most recently declared record type that has an age field of type int. The type int is inferred from the expression 13 <= x && x <= 19. The function is_teenager will only work with the found record type, here person.

Dealing With Errors
Exceptions
When a computatio;
val is_teenager : person -> bool = <fun>

# let s = gerard.surname;;
val s : string =     surname = "Huet";
     age = 76
  };;
val ger { first_name : string; surname : string; age : int; }

    susly shown, sum, length, and map functions provide examples of pattern matching over the list variant type.

Records
Like tuples, records also pack eleriant can be recursive if it refers to itself in its own definition. The predefined type list provides an example of such a variant:

# #show list;;
tunt
    | Range (lo, hi) -> 0 <= lo && lo <= hi && hi < page_count;;
val is_printable : int -> int --> true
    | Current -> 0 <= cur && cur < page_co_count cur range =
    match range with
    | All p_response -> int = <fun>

# let is_printable pageror_code code -> code;;
val http_status_code : htt  match response with
    | Data _ -> 200
    | Er int = <fun>

# let http_status_code response =
  
val colour_to_rgb : primary_colour -> int * int *Green -> (0, 0xff, 0)
    | Blue -> (0, 0, 0xff);;match colour with
    | Red -> (0xff, 0, 0)
    | s suggested in the first sentence of this section, variants go along with pattern matching. Here are some examples:

# let colour_to_rgb colour =
     type page_range =
    | All
    | Current
    | R_code 404
Here is something sitting in between:

#TYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>Dummy</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    Dummy Page\n  </body>\n</html>"

# Error_code 404;;

type primary_colour = Red | Green | Blue

Here is the defpe of tuples is written using * between the components' types.

Variant Types

vcess to the components of tuples is done using pattern matching. For instance, the predefined function snd returns the second component of a pair:

#  ([], false);;
- : 'a list * bool = ([], false)
AcK');;
- : int * string * char = (1, "one", 'K')

# of any type. Pairs are tuples that have two elements. Here is a 3-tuple and a pair:

Here is an example of a case that is not matched:

Polymorphic Functions on Lists
Here is how to wr int = <fun>

atching provides a means to inspect data of any kind, except functions. In this section, it is introduced on lists, and it will be generalised to other data types in the next section. Here is how pattern matching can be used to define a recursive function that computes the sum of a list of integers:

# let rec sum u =
    match u with
    | [] -> 0
;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4]
In OCaml, pattern ma are defined as being either empty, written [], or being an element x added at the front of another list u, which is written x :: u (the double colon operator is pronounced “cons”).

Lists may be the most common data type in OCaml. They are ordered collections of values having the same type. Here are a few examples.

In OCaml, +. is the at. To add floats, one must use +. instead of +:

# computation of a recursive step, except the last one. OCaml handles lists internally, as shown in the penultimate expression, but displays them as the last expression. This is just pretty printing. No computation takes place between the two last steps.

Each => sign corresponds to the 3 :: range 4 5

Loops such as for and while are available, but they are meant to be used when writing imperative OCaml in conjunction with mutable data. Otherwise, recursive functions should be preferred.

Here is an example of a function which 

Recursive Functions
A recursive function calls iwhich appears in their signature. The type unit has a single value, written () and pronounced “unit.” It is used as a placeholder when no data is passed or returned, but some token still has to be passed to start processing or indicate processing has terminated.

Input-output is an example of somethhe function read_line reads characters on standard input and returns them as a string when end-of-line (EOL) is reached. The function print_endline prints a string on standard output, followed by an EOL.

The function read_line doesn't need any datamcome aquí?";;
¿Cuándo se come aquí?
- : unit = ()
ring -> unit = <fun>

# print_endline "¿Cuándo se a
- : string = "caramba"

# print_endline;;
- : st : unit -> string = <fun>

# read_line ();;
caramb level input-output operations is done using functions. Here is an example of each:

# read_line;;
- polymorphic, meaning it has two implicit type variables: 'a and 'b (pronounced “alpha” and “beta”). They both can be anything; however, in regard to the function passed to List.map:

Input list elememed by applying the function provided as argument to each of the elements of the input list.

The fution of cat, behaves as follows:

# cat_hi "friend";;
- : string = "hi friend"
Type Parameters and Higher-Order Functions
A function may expect a function as a parameter, which is called a higher-order function. A well-known example of higher-order function is List.map. Here is how it can be used:

# List.map;;
- : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list = <fun>

# List.map (fun x -> x * x);;
- : int list -> int list = <fun>

# List.map (fun x -> x * x) [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5];;
- : int list = [0; 1; 4; 9; 16; 25]
The name of this function begins with List. because it is part of the predefined library of functions acting on lists. This matter will be discussed more later. Function List.map has two parameters: the second is a list, and the first is a function that can be applied to the list's elements, whatever they may be. List.map returns a list for. This is called a partial application. In the above, cat was partially applied to "hi".

The function cat_hi, which resulted from the partial applica.

# let cat_hi = cat "hi";;
val cat_hi : string -> string = <fun>
This returns a function that expects a single string, here the b from the definition of cat
The function cat has two string parameters, a and b, and returns a value of type string.

# cat "ha" "ha";;
- : string = "ha ha"
Functions don't have to be called with all the arguments they expect. It is possib

# (fun x -> x * x) 50;;
- : int = 2500
Functions with Multiple Parameters and Partial Application
A function may have several parameters, separated by spaces.

# let cat a b = a ^ " " ^ b;;
val ca
Anonymous Functions
Anonymous functions do not have a name, and they are defined with the fun keyword:

# fun x -> x * x;;
- : int -> int = <fun>
We can write anonymous functions and immediately apply them to a valu
- : suffix:string -> string -> bool = <fun>

# String.ends_with ~suffix:"less" "stateless";;
- : bool = true
Some functions, such as String.ends_with have labell
The REPL indicates that the type of square is int -> int. This means it is a function taking an int as argument (input) and returning an int as result (output). A functio
# let square x = x * x;;
val square : int -> int = <fun>

# square 50;;
- : int = 2500
This example defines a function named square with the single parameter x. Its function body is the expression x * x. There is no “return” keyword in OCaml.

When 
Functions
In OCaml, : a with value 1 and b with value 2. Then the example uses them in the expression a + b, resulting in the value of 3.

In OCaml, the equality symbol has two meanings. It is used in definitions and equality tests.

# let dummy = "hi" = "hello";;
val dummy : bool = false
This is interpreted as: “define dummy as the result of the structural equality t in
    a + b;;
- : int = 3
This defines two names = … in … is an expression, it can be used within another expression in order to have several values with their own names:

# let a = 1 in
  let b = 2ines the name y and binds it to the value 50. It is then used in the expression y * y, resulting in the value 2500. Note that y is only defined in the expression following the in keyword.

Since let …500

# y;;
Error: Unbound value y
This example deflocally, within an expression, using the let … = … in … syntax:

# let y = 50 in y * y;;
- : int = 2 Authors: Special Comments.

Names can be defined ** Feet in a mile *)
let feets = 5280;;
val feets x_plus_y works, x-plus-y does not.

Bindings can be given special comments (sometimes called "docstrings") that editors and tooling treat as related to the binding. These are denoted by adding a second * to the opening of the comment. For example:

( a lexical scope, names have a single value, which only depends on its definition.

Do not use dashes in names; use underscores instead. For example: be discussed in the Working With Mutable State section.

There is no overloading in OCaml, so inside
Values can be given names using the let keyword. This is called binding a value to a name. For example:

# let x = 50;;
val x : int = 50

# x * x;;
- : int = 2500
When entering let x = 50;;, OCaml responds with val x : int = 50, meaning that x is an identifier bound to value 50. So x * x;; evaluates to the same as 50 * 50;;.

Bindings in OCaml are immutable, meaning that the value assigned to a name never changes. Although x is often called a variable, it is not the case. It is in fact a constant. Using over-simplifying but acceptable words, all variables are immutable in OCaml. It is and types:
                                                                                                                                              can be empty [] (pronounced “nil”). Note that the first list has been given a name using the let … = … construction, which is detailed below. The most primitive operation on lists is to add a new element at the front of an existing list. This is done using the “cons” operator, written with the double colon operator ::.

# 9 :: u;;
- : int list = [9; 1; 2; 3; 4]
In OCaml, if … then … else … is not a statement; it is an expression.

# 2 * if "hello" = "world" then 3 else 5;;
- : int = 10
The source beginning at if and ending at 5 is parsed as a single integer expression that is multiplied by 2. OCaml has no need for two different test construct
# 6.28;;
- : float = 6.28

# "This is really disco!";;
- : string = "This is really disco!"

# 'a';; (* Note the single quotes *)
- : char = 'a'

# true;;
- : bool = true
OCaml has type inference. It automatically determines the type of an expression without much guidance from the programmer. Lists have a dedicated tutorial. For the time being, the following two expressions are both lists. The former contains integers, and the latter, strings.

# let u = [1; 2; 3; 4];;
val u : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4]

# ["this"; "is"; "mambo"];;
- : string list = ["this"; "is"; "mambo"]
The lists' types, int list and string list, have been inferred from the type of their elements. Lists ame.
